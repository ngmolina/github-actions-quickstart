# github-actions-quickstart

## FEEDBACK
As someone who has been using GitHub for school for the past few years, I found this really easy to follow. The directions were clear and I was able to follow them smoothly and achieve the end goal. The appropriate resources were also provided if we wanted to learn more about what exactly was going on. The prerequisite section is also a great addition for users overall as it enables them to ensure they are actually prepared to do this task.
